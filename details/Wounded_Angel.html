        The Wounded Angel fresco is one of Hugo Simberg's most famous works. The painting was painted in oil in 1903 and awarded a State's Prize in 1904. The original painting is housed in the Ateneum Art Museum, Ahlström collection.

        Simberg painted another version of the painting in Tampere Cathedral incorporating a Tampere background with factory chimneys. At the time, Tampere Cathedral was intended to serve the increasing population of Tampere city, which was undergoing significant social change and modernization.

        The painting depicts two boys carrying a wounded angel with wings, depicted with a blindfold. One of the boys looks directly at the viewer, while the other gazes downward. The wounded angel contradicts our perception of an angel. The wounded angel challenges our traditional perception of angels, as creatures with purity and free from pain. Rather, the angel in the painting appears vulnerable, hurt, and suffering from emotional or physical pain, potentially inflicted by humans.

        Hugo Simberg did not provide a specific interpretation or title for the painting. Like many of Simberg's works, the Wounded Angel is open to interpretation, allowing viewers to form their own meanings. There are various interpretations, including the wounded angel representing Christ's suffering on the cross, or serving as a metaphor for the painters' own suffering. It is known that Simberg was battling illness during the time of painting.
