        The last two windows on the north side are connected, in terms of meaning and shape of the windows. These two windows can be interpreted as an apocalyptic reference. The window on the left side shows two horses, white and red, and a knight in black riding them. The colors attached meanings that convey different messages. The interpretation is that the white horse represents Christ, while the red one represents war.

        The white horse and its rider are faithful and true, who fight rightfully. He wears crowns like a royal, holding a bow, and his clothes are covered in blood. On the other hand, the knight riding the red horse holds a knife and has a red feather on his head. He represents evilness, who wants to bring chaos to the world. Take away the peace from the earth, set people against each other. The two riders stand out from each other, as one is bright white, and the other one is dark-black. They represent two opposites: peace, and war.
