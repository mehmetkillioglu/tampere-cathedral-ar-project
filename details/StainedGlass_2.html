        The window on the north side of the cathedral, also designed by Hugo Simberg, shows a pelican feeding its chicks. The stained glass features a pelican wounded on its heart, bleeding.

        The pelican symbolizes Christ, as it feeds its chicks standing on a cross. It feeds its chicks with the blood from its heart, which refers to Christ and his congregation. The glass window draws attention to the blood, portrayed as a shiny, glowing color. The colors look united and in harmony; the background is reddish, similar to the heart of the pelican. In some interpretations, the pelican as a symbol represents the sacrifice of Christ for mankind.
