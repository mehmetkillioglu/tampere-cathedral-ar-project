        Hugo Simberg designed The Dove of the Holy Spirit stained-glass window. The white dove symbolizes the Holy Spirit with wings wide open and the dove is coming from the South. The white dove shines over a purple and grey background. The colors surrounding the dove create a heavenly sense. The white dove represents the purity and peace that comes from its color. The vibrant color around the dove may symbolize enlightenment and wisdom. As the dove has a meaning in Christianity, the interpretations around the Dove and the Holy Spirit can vary.
