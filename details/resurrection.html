        The Resurrection is a work of Magnus Enckell, painted in 1907 on the altar. The Resurrection painting measures around 10 meters wide and 4 meters high, and it is Enckell's only fresco.

        The Resurrection is based on the Last Judgment of the End of Day, featuring dead arising from the grave, while the right side shows the procession to eternal life. The painting is not like other traditional versions, rather is a simplistic interpretation.

        The painting does not impersonalize the characters walking toward the light. Three figures stand out: a woman, a man, and a young boy. A faint light emanates from beneath the woman's clothing, the man's hips are covered with a small cloth, and the nudity of the boy shows that he has not yet entered puberty.

        Some interpretations of the painting suggest that Enchell's exclusion of spiritual figures like angels or God draws attention to the sun, a symbol of life force, as the source of salvation. Enchell's interpretation of The Resurrection is considered a modern take on the Resurrection.
