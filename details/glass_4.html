        The window is designed by Hugo Simberg, with a resemblance to this other work in the cathedral. The window reminds the viewer of “The Garden of Death”, which is a fresco on the first floor of the building. The window depicts a skeleton in green, riding a yellow horse. The second horse carries a white-clothed, red-haired rider; and holds a scale in his hand. They are flying above the clouds, in between red flames.

        These two horsemen represent death and hunger. The scales the white horseman holds may represent the wheat and barley. As many debates around Simberg’s art in the cathedral, he chooses a skeleton as the reminder of death. Even though a symbol of death is not commonly seen in a sacred place, it may be chosen to remind us of the inevitability of death. The window reflects the macabre, which centralizes the symbols of death.
