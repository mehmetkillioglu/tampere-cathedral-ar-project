        There are many meanings of snakes in various cultures. In Christianity, it symbolizes sin and temptation. Depicted with an apple in its mouth, the serpent in the painting makes a clear reference to Adam and Eve. Likely, the depiction of the serpent with an apple in its mouth aligns with the traditional Christian interpretation of the serpent as a symbol of evil. In the painting, the serpent reaches an unknown place, which can be interpreted as the possibility of redemption.

        The painting caused debates in its time by some of the conservative groups that objected to Simberg's artistic style and symbolism. They believed that the painting is inappropriate and detract from the cathedral's sacredness and historical significance. The painting brought up the questions of good and evil, and the human condition. Some figures objected that religious art should be free from interpretation and symbolism. The meaning of the painting can vary depending on the viewer's perspective.
