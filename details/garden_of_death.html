        The Garden of Death was first painted in 1896 and is located in Ateneum, Helsinki. Hugo Simberg made several versions with different techniques, one fresco version present at the Tampere Cathedral.

        Hugo Simberg, who usually preferred to leave the interpretation to viewers, noted that this piece of work represents “the place where the dead end up before going to heaven.” The painting depicts three skeletons in a garden, watering the plants and caring for the flowers. Here, death is depicted as peaceful, rather than scary.

        The flower symbolically represents life and birth. The contradiction aligns with Simberg's attained meaning of the last stop before heaven. The painting conveys that death and life follow each other as a never-ending cycle, where death itself cares for the flourishing of life, symbolized by the flowers.

        The first appearance of the painting caused debates by Church authorities, claiming that the painting leaves a place for interpretation. Authorities believed the biblical characters should be portrayed as traditional religious imagery without any symbolic reference. In time, the fresco found its place in Tampere Cathedral.
