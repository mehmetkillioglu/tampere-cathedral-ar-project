        Designed by Hugo Simberg, the illustration in the window is the Burning Bush. The Burning Bush interpretation comes from a conversation between God and Moses, in which God advises Moses to stay away from the bush places in the Holy Land.

        The art piece heavily carries the National Romantic style. The window's bright red color reminds the flames, rising from strong roots. Two white birds raise a big black cross upper part of the window.
