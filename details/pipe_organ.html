        Master Albanus Yerva made the organ on the second floor of the cathedral in Lahti. The instrument is the biggest organ in Finland. It consists of 63 stops and 4000 pipes. It is also considered to be the most romantic organ in Finland.

        The window behind the organ depicts a shining sun representing the Lord. The sun windows are not completely visible since the organ covers a big part. Magnus Enckell’s son Jorgen Enckell said that his father designed this window.
